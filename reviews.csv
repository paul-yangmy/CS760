9,9,False,22,12725,"Great game just a real shame that hackers can force hacked items into your inventory thus getting you banned with no warning and no hope of getting it undone. Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all. I had to literally go offline for the aldrichs faithful area cause of how insane it gets. Which is sad cause i used to love the coop community and the invasion community. I love taking part of it and doing the covenant stuff but this just goes to an extreme. Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react......that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one.

stopping family share wont solve the problem, because the problem this game faces cant inherently be solved in a way that wont either a) make the community turn against you or b) kill the game outright. 
sure, ive had to make several alts because of hackers getting me banned but guess what, family share let me keep enjoying this 5 year old game because guess what From/bandai, people that enjoy playing your game will do what needs to be done to keep enjoying it. by removing the only way around your ultra specific yet vague TOS and ban detection, anyone that gets banned now will have to contact you guys directly causing more work to be done on your part to again, which most people dont wanna do because actually getting in contact with the support team is about as direct as trying to get help from steam support 3 years ago. 
what you have done will ultimately kill the game, cheaters will just keep doing what they do because thats what cheaters do, sure it will deter a few, but those that keep plugging along will enjoy having the knowledge that if they inject invalid items into multiple inventories at once that they will have caused more turmoil and rage than normal because now, its either BUY THE GAME AGAIN or spend 2 weeks just trying to get unbanned, and with your support team being as small as it is, this process could take longer and longer until people find the effort and money not worth it and then permanently stop playing your game. and then the cheaters/trolls will have won. 
you gave us the worst solution other than outright turning off the server

39,39,False,2,4361,"Well, I did it.  I've finished the final Dark Souls game.  This marks the end of my ongoing project to play through the entire series (or what exists of it on PC), in order.  

I came into this endeavor with a moderate dislike for Dark Souls, failing to get more than a few hours into the first game, despite several attempts.  However, I'm pleased to report that after playing all of them through to completion, beating the DLC content, and defeating the optional bosses (i.e. finally managing to ""git good""), I've completely changed my mind.  I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. 

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.

Bans can be issued on backups, or even when you transfer saves between accounts.
Bans can be issued on mods that don't give any innate advantages to play.
Bans can last indefinitely (9+ months on wiped data).

For me, this just constantly makes me wonder if I'm doing the right thing, instead of being able to enjoy the game. It really punishes you for not making a good ""build"" and has exceptions to lots of rules and you end up playing 80% of the time and googling the other 20%. There are also lots of characters to talk to and items and pick up in an exact order in random parts of the maps, even places where you've been before ages ago. And sometimes you should kill these NPCs and sometimes you shouldn't. More googling required.

100,100,False,1,13322,"After finishing all the content Dark Souls 3 had to offer, I edited my initial review that was made during a huge burst of rage.

Despite this making me very sad, I still keep on the not recommended rating though if there was a middle ground I would have chosen that.

To sum it up in one sentence, Dark Souls 1 and Dark souls 2 were hard, sometimes brutal but mostly fair with an occasional BS here and there, but that could be forgiven by looking at the overall picture that those iterations of the game conveyed. In Dark Souls 3 however, you have a constant feeling of unfair difficulty made just for the sake of making it difficult. 

That is a real shame becaue DS3 is the most gorgeous looking best polished dark souls game a dame that all souls fans want to experience. 
There are two fundamental issues with tha mid and late boss difficulty. (Mind you, I prevailed over all of them, all beaten melee&solo even though some of them took me long hours of struggle.)
1. The camera issue. Looking here at Midir(of course), Twin princes teleport, Nameless King  first phase, even sister Friede 3rd phase with the BS jump.
3. Having bosses at Bloodborne speed level while you are stuck at DS3 mechanics level: Sister friede as most notorius, Midir laser attack, pointiff Sullivan, Dancer at time and others. good luck dodging them.
4. The difficulty curve: The game stars very mild until you hit the Abyyss Watchers and later Pontiff two huge difficulty spikes, later followed by Sister Friede and Midir. While its OK to have brutally challenging DLC bosses it would not hurt to have fari challenge as well.

From a positive perspective I like the graphics, the combat, and most of the levels. I like some of the bosses:
-Slave knight Gael (an end boss done right, brutally hard but mostly fair with an occasional BS = an attack that is not telegraphed well enough)
-Champion Gundyr
-Abyss watchers (after learning the boss, the iniotial encounter made me quit this game for a year)
-Lord of Cinder
-Nameless king 2nd phase, (first phase is a disaster)
-Dragonslayer Armor

As a conclusion if you are new to the series stay away from DS3. Play the first then the second iteration, not because of the lore knowledge but because of overall arc of bosses and difficulty. DS1 is the best of all series both the ingenious environment and boss design.

114,114,False,2,2670,"Dark Souls III have been praised as a video game classic, but it is by no means a perfect game, and the faults of this game are often overlooked due to the status of it being a Dark Souls game, with any complaints regarding game design receiving an answer of just ""git gud"".

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard.
 [*]The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right.
 [*]A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc.
 [*]Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend.
 [*]Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo.
 [*]The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless.
 [*]The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.
[/list]

[b]The good:[/b]

 [*]Lore and Atmosphere like no other game
 [*]Diversity of bosses and their move-sets
 [*]The challenge is somewhat rewarding, but, personally, most of the time I feel ""wow, I'm glad this shit-show is finally over"" and not ""omg, what an amazing boss fight this was"".

Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

so originally i had owned this game for PS3 and thought to myself after 100s of hours wow this game would be awesome if it could be modded so i had bought it for PC and knew nothing of the ban system (as a side note OMFG why DOES THIS GAME BAN PEOPLE SO EASILY BUT NEVER TOUCHES THE GRIEFFING HACKERS WTF) instantly i get in the game alter my stats so pretty much go through the game in a day because i was not there for the base game i was there for the modding of the game. tues comes around and in the same instant i modded my stats i get banned :/ ""ok no worries i clearly caused it"". 

so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3. But then the salty hackers comes online. I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. 

i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.

so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.

I also feel like i cant criticize this game without all the fanboys acting like i just butchered their Sacred cow. I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all. I had to literally go offline for the aldrichs faithful area cause of how insane it gets. Which is sad cause i used to love the coop community and the invasion community.

Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react......that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one. ""go offline"" isn't a solution its a testament to how bad this game is with pvp.

stopping family share wont solve the problem, because the problem this game faces cant inherently be solved in a way that wont either a) make the community turn against you or b) kill the game outright. 
sure, ive had to make several alts because of hackers getting me banned but guess what, family share let me keep enjoying this 5 year old game because guess what From/bandai, people that enjoy playing your game will do what needs to be done to keep enjoying it. by removing the only way around your ultra specific yet vague TOS and ban detection, anyone that gets banned now will have to contact you guys directly causing more work to be done on your part to again, which most people dont wanna do because actually getting in contact with the support team is about as direct as trying to get help from steam support 3 years ago. 
what you have done will ultimately kill the game, cheaters will just keep doing what they do because thats what cheaters do, sure it will deter a few, but those that keep plugging along will enjoy having the knowledge that if they inject invalid items into multiple inventories at once that they will have caused more turmoil and rage than normal because now, its either BUY THE GAME AGAIN or spend 2 weeks just trying to get unbanned, and with your support team being as small as it is, this process could take longer and longer until people find the effort and money not worth it and then permanently stop playing your game. and then the cheaters/trolls will have won. 
you gave us the worst solution other than outright turning off the server

158,158,False,2,4361,"Well, I did it.  I've finished the final Dark Souls game.  This marks the end of my ongoing project to play through the entire series (or what exists of it on PC), in order.  

I came into this endeavor with a moderate dislike for Dark Souls, failing to get more than a few hours into the first game, despite several attempts.  However, I'm pleased to report that after playing all of them through to completion, beating the DLC content, and defeating the optional bosses (i.e. finally managing to ""git good""), I've completely changed my mind.  I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. 

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.  However, the reality is that neither this game, nor its nightmarishly bad predecessor improve enough about Dark Souls to justify their combined existence.

Despite this making me very sad, I still keep on the not recommended rating though if there was a middle ground I would have chosen that.

To sum it up in one sentence, Dark Souls 1 and Dark souls 2 were hard, sometimes brutal but mostly fair with an occasional BS here and there, but that could be forgiven by looking at the overall picture that those iterations of the game conveyed. In Dark Souls 3 however, you have a constant feeling of unfair difficulty made just for the sake of making it difficult. 

That is a real shame becaue DS3 is the most gorgeous looking best polished dark souls game a dame that all souls fans want to experience. 
There are two fundamental issues with tha mid and late boss difficulty. (Mind you, I prevailed over all of them, all beaten melee&solo even though some of them took me long hours of struggle.)
1. The camera issue. Looking here at Midir(of course), Twin princes teleport, Nameless King  first phase, even sister Friede 3rd phase with the BS jump.
3. Having bosses at Bloodborne speed level while you are stuck at DS3 mechanics level: Sister friede as most notorius, Midir laser attack, pointiff Sullivan, Dancer at time and others. good luck dodging them.
4. The difficulty curve: The game stars very mild until you hit the Abyyss Watchers and later Pontiff two huge difficulty spikes, later followed by Sister Friede and Midir. While its OK to have brutally challenging DLC bosses it would not hurt to have fari challenge as well.

From a positive perspective I like the graphics, the combat, and most of the levels. I like some of the bosses:
-Slave knight Gael (an end boss done right, brutally hard but mostly fair with an occasional BS = an attack that is not telegraphed well enough)
-Champion Gundyr
-Abyss watchers (after learning the boss, the iniotial encounter made me quit this game for a year)
-Lord of Cinder
-Nameless king 2nd phase, (first phase is a disaster)
-Dragonslayer Armor

As a conclusion if you are new to the series stay away from DS3. Play the first then the second iteration, not because of the lore knowledge but because of overall arc of bosses and difficulty. DS1 is the best of all series both the ingenious environment and boss design.

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard.
 [*]The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right.
 [*]A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc.
 [*]Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend.
 [*]Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo.
 [*]The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless.
 [*]The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.
[/list]

[b]The good:[/b]

 [*]Lore and Atmosphere like no other game
 [*]Diversity of bosses and their move-sets
 [*]The challenge is somewhat rewarding, but, personally, most of the time I feel ""wow, I'm glad this shit-show is finally over"" and not ""omg, what an amazing boss fight this was"".

The anti-cheat will ban innocent players because cheaters injected items into your game. Hundreds of hours wasted because From is too lazy. If you intent to play the game normally and use online aspects you are forced to manually save your files, download 3rd party programs that apparently bypass the broken anti-cheat TO PROTECT YOU from wrongfully getting banned and even then you might still get penalized because another player decided to cheat in your game. Unacceptable.

They also recently got rid of Family Share which helped players who were wrongfully banned and lost their characters to still play.

246,246,False,22,12725,"Great game just a real shame that hackers can force hacked items into your inventory thus getting you banned with no warning and no hope of getting it undone. Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3. But then the salty hackers comes online. I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. 

i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.

so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.

Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one.

260,260,False,16,13233,"This is one of my favorite games of all time. But disabling family share is one of the worst decisions Bandai could have made right now. As it stands, the anti-cheat system does very little besides punish innocent players. Hackers who know what they are doing can easily avoid getting soft banned.

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

338,338,False,1,13322,"After finishing all the content Dark Souls 3 had to offer, I edited my initial review that was made during a huge burst of rage.

Despite this making me very sad, I still keep on the not recommended rating though if there was a middle ground I would have chosen that.

To sum it up in one sentence, Dark Souls 1 and Dark souls 2 were hard, sometimes brutal but mostly fair with an occasional BS here and there, but that could be forgiven by looking at the overall picture that those iterations of the game conveyed. In Dark Souls 3 however, you have a constant feeling of unfair difficulty made just for the sake of making it difficult. 

That is a real shame becaue DS3 is the most gorgeous looking best polished dark souls game a dame that all souls fans want to experience. 
There are two fundamental issues with tha mid and late boss difficulty. (Mind you, I prevailed over all of them, all beaten melee&solo even though some of them took me long hours of struggle.)
1. The camera issue. Looking here at Midir(of course), Twin princes teleport, Nameless King  first phase, even sister Friede 3rd phase with the BS jump.
3. Having bosses at Bloodborne speed level while you are stuck at DS3 mechanics level: Sister friede as most notorius, Midir laser attack, pointiff Sullivan, Dancer at time and others. good luck dodging them.
4. The difficulty curve: The game stars very mild until you hit the Abyyss Watchers and later Pontiff two huge difficulty spikes, later followed by Sister Friede and Midir. While its OK to have brutally challenging DLC bosses it would not hurt to have fari challenge as well.

From a positive perspective I like the graphics, the combat, and most of the levels. I like some of the bosses:
-Slave knight Gael (an end boss done right, brutally hard but mostly fair with an occasional BS = an attack that is not telegraphed well enough)
-Champion Gundyr
-Abyss watchers (after learning the boss, the iniotial encounter made me quit this game for a year)
-Lord of Cinder
-Nameless king 2nd phase, (first phase is a disaster)
-Dragonslayer Armor

As a conclusion if you are new to the series stay away from DS3. Play the first then the second iteration, not because of the lore knowledge but because of overall arc of bosses and difficulty. DS1 is the best of all series both the ingenious environment and boss design.

352,352,False,2,2670,"Dark Souls III have been praised as a video game classic, but it is by no means a perfect game, and the faults of this game are often overlooked due to the status of it being a Dark Souls game, with any complaints regarding game design receiving an answer of just ""git gud"".

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard.
 [*]The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right.
 [*]A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc.
 [*]Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend.
 [*]Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo.
 [*]The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless.
 [*]The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.
[/list]

[b]The good:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Lore and Atmosphere like no other game
 [*]Diversity of bosses and their move-sets
 [*]The challenge is somewhat rewarding, but, personally, most of the time I feel ""wow, I'm glad this shit-show is finally over"" and not ""omg, what an amazing boss fight this was"".

Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

so originally i had owned this game for PS3 and thought to myself after 100s of hours wow this game would be awesome if it could be modded so i had bought it for PC and knew nothing of the ban system (as a side note OMFG why DOES THIS GAME BAN PEOPLE SO EASILY BUT NEVER TOUCHES THE GRIEFFING HACKERS WTF) instantly i get in the game alter my stats so pretty much go through the game in a day because i was not there for the base game i was there for the modding of the game. tues comes around and in the same instant i modded my stats i get banned :/ ""ok no worries i clearly caused it"". 

so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3. But then the salty hackers comes online. I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. 

i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.

so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.

I also feel like i cant criticize this game without all the fanboys acting like i just butchered their Sacred cow. I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all. I had to literally go offline for the aldrichs faithful area cause of how insane it gets. Which is sad cause i used to love the coop community and the invasion community.

Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react......that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one. ""go offline"" isn't a solution its a testament to how bad this game is with pvp.

stopping family share wont solve the problem, because the problem this game faces cant inherently be solved in a way that wont either a) make the community turn against you or b) kill the game outright. 
sure, ive had to make several alts because of hackers getting me banned but guess what, family share let me keep enjoying this 5 year old game because guess what From/bandai, people that enjoy playing your game will do what needs to be done to keep enjoying it. by removing the only way around your ultra specific yet vague TOS and ban detection, anyone that gets banned now will have to contact you guys directly causing more work to be done on your part to again, which most people dont wanna do because actually getting in contact with the support team is about as direct as trying to get help from steam support 3 years ago. 
what you have done will ultimately kill the game, cheaters will just keep doing what they do because thats what cheaters do, sure it will deter a few, but those that keep plugging along will enjoy having the knowledge that if they inject invalid items into multiple inventories at once that they will have caused more turmoil and rage than normal because now, its either BUY THE GAME AGAIN or spend 2 weeks just trying to get unbanned, and with your support team being as small as it is, this process could take longer and longer until people find the effort and money not worth it and then permanently stop playing your game. and then the cheaters/trolls will have won.

396,396,False,2,4361,"Well, I did it.  I've finished the final Dark Souls game.  This marks the end of my ongoing project to play through the entire series (or what exists of it on PC), in order.  

I came into this endeavor with a moderate dislike for Dark Souls, failing to get more than a few hours into the first game, despite several attempts.  However, I'm pleased to report that after playing all of them through to completion, beating the DLC content, and defeating the optional bosses (i.e. finally managing to ""git good""), I've completely changed my mind.  I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. 

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.  However, the reality is that neither this game, nor its nightmarishly bad predecessor improve enough about Dark Souls to justify their combined existence.

457,457,False,1,13322,"After finishing all the content Dark Souls 3 had to offer, I edited my initial review that was made during a huge burst of rage.

Despite this making me very sad, I still keep on the not recommended rating though if there was a middle ground I would have chosen that.

To sum it up in one sentence, Dark Souls 1 and Dark souls 2 were hard, sometimes brutal but mostly fair with an occasional BS here and there, but that could be forgiven by looking at the overall picture that those iterations of the game conveyed. In Dark Souls 3 however, you have a constant feeling of unfair difficulty made just for the sake of making it difficult. 

That is a real shame becaue DS3 is the most gorgeous looking best polished dark souls game a dame that all souls fans want to experience. 
There are two fundamental issues with tha mid and late boss difficulty. (Mind you, I prevailed over all of them, all beaten melee&solo even though some of them took me long hours of struggle.)
1. The camera issue. Looking here at Midir(of course), Twin princes teleport, Nameless King  first phase, even sister Friede 3rd phase with the BS jump.
3. Having bosses at Bloodborne speed level while you are stuck at DS3 mechanics level: Sister friede as most notorius, Midir laser attack, pointiff Sullivan, Dancer at time and others. good luck dodging them.
4. The difficulty curve: The game stars very mild until you hit the Abyyss Watchers and later Pontiff two huge difficulty spikes, later followed by Sister Friede and Midir. While its OK to have brutally challenging DLC bosses it would not hurt to have fari challenge as well.

From a positive perspective I like the graphics, the combat, and most of the levels. I like some of the bosses:
-Slave knight Gael (an end boss done right, brutally hard but mostly fair with an occasional BS = an attack that is not telegraphed well enough)
-Champion Gundyr
-Abyss watchers (after learning the boss, the iniotial encounter made me quit this game for a year)
-Lord of Cinder
-Nameless king 2nd phase, (first phase is a disaster)
-Dragonslayer Armor

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard.
 [*]The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right.
 [*]A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc.
 [*]Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend.
 [*]Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo.
 [*]The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless.
 [*]The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.
[/list]

[b]The good:[/b]

 [*]Lore and Atmosphere like no other game
 [*]Diversity of bosses and their move-sets
 [*]The challenge is somewhat rewarding, but, personally, most of the time I feel ""wow, I'm glad this shit-show is finally over"" and not ""omg, what an amazing boss fight this was"".

The anti-cheat will ban innocent players because cheaters injected items into your game. Hundreds of hours wasted because From is too lazy. If you intent to play the game normally and use online aspects you are forced to manually save your files, download 3rd party programs that apparently bypass the broken anti-cheat TO PROTECT YOU from wrongfully getting banned and even then you might still get penalized because another player decided to cheat in your game.

484,484,False,22,12725,"Great game just a real shame that hackers can force hacked items into your inventory thus getting you banned with no warning and no hope of getting it undone. Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3. But then the salty hackers comes online. I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. 

i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.

so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.

However, I'm pleased to report that after playing all of them through to completion, beating the DLC content, and defeating the optional bosses (i.e. finally managing to ""git good""), I've completely changed my mind.  I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. 

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.

Bans can be issued on backups, or even when you transfer saves between accounts.
Bans can be issued on mods that don't give any innate advantages to play.
Bans can last indefinitely (9+ months on wiped data).
Family Sharing was a cool way to continue to enjoy the game despite its terrible ban system and without having to pay for an additional copy. You almost always had to start from scratch, and that always sucked but at least it was possible.
They did away with that, so I recommend you do away with them.

576,576,False,1,13322,"After finishing all the content Dark Souls 3 had to offer, I edited my initial review that was made during a huge burst of rage.

Despite this making me very sad, I still keep on the not recommended rating though if there was a middle ground I would have chosen that.

To sum it up in one sentence, Dark Souls 1 and Dark souls 2 were hard, sometimes brutal but mostly fair with an occasional BS here and there, but that could be forgiven by looking at the overall picture that those iterations of the game conveyed. In Dark Souls 3 however, you have a constant feeling of unfair difficulty made just for the sake of making it difficult. 

That is a real shame becaue DS3 is the most gorgeous looking best polished dark souls game a dame that all souls fans want to experience. 
There are two fundamental issues with tha mid and late boss difficulty. (Mind you, I prevailed over all of them, all beaten melee&solo even though some of them took me long hours of struggle.)
1. The camera issue. Looking here at Midir(of course), Twin princes teleport, Nameless King  first phase, even sister Friede 3rd phase with the BS jump.
3. Having bosses at Bloodborne speed level while you are stuck at DS3 mechanics level: Sister friede as most notorius, Midir laser attack, pointiff Sullivan, Dancer at time and others. good luck dodging them.
4. The difficulty curve: The game stars very mild until you hit the Abyyss Watchers and later Pontiff two huge difficulty spikes, later followed by Sister Friede and Midir. While its OK to have brutally challenging DLC bosses it would not hurt to have fari challenge as well.

From a positive perspective I like the graphics, the combat, and most of the levels. I like some of the bosses:
-Slave knight Gael (an end boss done right, brutally hard but mostly fair with an occasional BS = an attack that is not telegraphed well enough)
-Champion Gundyr
-Abyss watchers (after learning the boss, the iniotial encounter made me quit this game for a year)
-Lord of Cinder
-Nameless king 2nd phase, (first phase is a disaster)
-Dragonslayer Armor

As a conclusion if you are new to the series stay away from DS3. Play the first then the second iteration, not because of the lore knowledge but because of overall arc of bosses and difficulty. DS1 is the best of all series both the ingenious environment and boss design.

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard.
 [*]The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right.
 [*]A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc.
 [*]Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend.
 [*]Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo.
 [*]The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless.
 [*]The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.

Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3. But then the salty hackers comes online. I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. 

i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.

so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.

stats so pretty much go through the game in a day because i was not there for the base game i was there for the modding of the game  tues comes around and in the same instant i modded my stats i get banned     ok no worries i clearly caused it     so i learn about family share  nice  make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats  bannable  and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be amazing   so i make one myself do a few matches in a high pvp area get all around well reception     but then the salty hackers comes online  i had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the  void lord  causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard  now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game every effect and every change must be manually imputed every time you launch the game this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting    i start my walk through the city not hiding that the  hacks  are in place i also want to point out that my  boss character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy  but no a hacker who s character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me  not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse   but stormy  you say  you were hacking you deserve this  i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the pvp element to the game  so i think to myself  ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this  log off and try again tomorrow   so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun as the whole thing was supposed to be  but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also hacks the family share account to forcefully disable the family share on the game   so yes if you ask is the game worth it on pc hell no  the publisher is to ignorant to figure out how to appropriately make a proper ban system and allows constant griefers to run rampant in the

I also feel like i cant criticize this game without all the fanboys acting like i just butchered their Sacred cow. I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all. I had to literally go offline for the aldrichs faithful area cause of how insane it gets. Which is sad cause i used to love the coop community and the invasion community.

Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react......that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one. ""go offline"" isn't a solution its a testament to how bad this game is with pvp.

what you have done will ultimately kill the game, cheaters will just keep doing what they do because thats what cheaters do, sure it will deter a few, but those that keep plugging along will enjoy having the knowledge that if they inject invalid items into multiple inventories at once that they will have caused more turmoil and rage than normal because now, its either BUY THE GAME AGAIN or spend 2 weeks just trying to get unbanned, and with your support team being as small as it is, this process could take longer and longer until people find the effort and money not worth it and then permanently stop playing your game. and then the cheaters/trolls will have won.

As shitty as that situation was you COULD just make another stream account and family share the game to your new account to get yourself UN-Banned.

634,634,False,2,4361,"Well, I did it.  I've finished the final Dark Souls game.  This marks the end of my ongoing project to play through the entire series (or what exists of it on PC), in order.  

I came into this endeavor with a moderate dislike for Dark Souls, failing to get more than a few hours into the first game, despite several attempts.  However, I'm pleased to report that after playing all of them through to completion, beating the DLC content, and defeating the optional bosses (i.e. finally managing to ""git good""), I've completely changed my mind.  I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. 

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.  However, the reality is that neither this game, nor its nightmarishly bad predecessor improve enough about Dark Souls to justify their combined existence.

695,695,False,1,13322,"After finishing all the content Dark Souls 3 had to offer, I edited my initial review that was made during a huge burst of rage.

Despite this making me very sad, I still keep on the not recommended rating though if there was a middle ground I would have chosen that.

To sum it up in one sentence, Dark Souls 1 and Dark souls 2 were hard, sometimes brutal but mostly fair with an occasional BS here and there, but that could be forgiven by looking at the overall picture that those iterations of the game conveyed. In Dark Souls 3 however, you have a constant feeling of unfair difficulty made just for the sake of making it difficult. 

That is a real shame becaue DS3 is the most gorgeous looking best polished dark souls game a dame that all souls fans want to experience. 
There are two fundamental issues with tha mid and late boss difficulty. (Mind you, I prevailed over all of them, all beaten melee&solo even though some of them took me long hours of struggle.)
1. The camera issue. Looking here at Midir(of course), Twin princes teleport, Nameless King  first phase, even sister Friede 3rd phase with the BS jump.
3. Having bosses at Bloodborne speed level while you are stuck at DS3 mechanics level: Sister friede as most notorius, Midir laser attack, pointiff Sullivan, Dancer at time and others. good luck dodging them.
4. The difficulty curve: The game stars very mild until you hit the Abyyss Watchers and later Pontiff two huge difficulty spikes, later followed by Sister Friede and Midir. While its OK to have brutally challenging DLC bosses it would not hurt to have fari challenge as well.

From a positive perspective I like the graphics, the combat, and most of the levels. I like some of the bosses:
-Slave knight Gael (an end boss done right, brutally hard but mostly fair with an occasional BS = an attack that is not telegraphed well enough)
-Champion Gundyr
-Abyss watchers (after learning the boss, the iniotial encounter made me quit this game for a year)
-Lord of Cinder
-Nameless king 2nd phase, (first phase is a disaster)
-Dragonslayer Armor

As a conclusion if you are new to the series stay away from DS3. Play the first then the second iteration, not because of the lore knowledge but because of overall arc of bosses and difficulty. DS1 is the best of all series both the ingenious environment and boss design.

However this (my primary account) got soft banned a long time ago due to hackers modifying my character and never got unbanned after clearing my data.  So I had to use family sharing as my account to this day is still penalized.  Now my choices are: Buy this game again because of someone else or play only with people who have also been soft banned (my friends who play are not on said list).  If From Software was going to decide to do this they should at least ACTIVELY restore wrongfully punished accounts.

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard.
 [*]The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right.
 [*]A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc.
 [*]Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend.
 [*]Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo.
 [*]The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless.
 [*]The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.
[/list]

[b]The good:[/b]

 [*]Lore and Atmosphere like no other game
 [*]Diversity of bosses and their move-sets
 [*]The challenge is somewhat rewarding, but, personally, most of the time I feel ""wow, I'm glad this shit-show is finally over"" and not ""omg, what an amazing boss fight this was"".

Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3.

I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. 

i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me.

so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.

Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all.

Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react......that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one. ""go offline"" isn't a solution its a testament to how bad this game is with pvp.

what you have done will ultimately kill the game, cheaters will just keep doing what they do because thats what cheaters do, sure it will deter a few, but those that keep plugging along will enjoy having the knowledge that if they inject invalid items into multiple inventories at once that they will have caused more turmoil and rage than normal because now, its either BUY THE GAME AGAIN or spend 2 weeks just trying to get unbanned, and with your support team being as small as it is, this process could take longer and longer until people find the effort and money not worth it and then permanently stop playing your game. and then the cheaters/trolls will have won.

I came into this endeavor with a moderate dislike for Dark Souls, failing to get more than a few hours into the first game, despite several attempts.  However, I'm pleased to report that after playing all of them through to completion, beating the DLC content, and defeating the optional bosses (i.e. finally managing to ""git good""), I've completely changed my mind.  I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. 

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.  However, the reality is that neither this game, nor its nightmarishly bad predecessor improve enough about Dark Souls to justify their combined existence.

This game's ban system is dogshit.
Pure unadulterated automated robotic dogshit.
Bans can be issued when other players inject bad data onto your file.
Bans can be issued on backups, or even when you transfer saves between accounts.
Bans can be issued on mods that don't give any innate advantages to play.
Bans can last indefinitely (9+ months on wiped data).
Family Sharing was a cool way to continue to enjoy the game despite its terrible ban system and without having to pay for an additional copy. You almost always had to start from scratch, and that always sucked but at least it was possible.
They did away with that, so I recommend you do away with them.

814,814,False,1,13322,"After finishing all the content Dark Souls 3 had to offer, I edited my initial review that was made during a huge burst of rage.

Despite this making me very sad, I still keep on the not recommended rating though if there was a middle ground I would have chosen that.

To sum it up in one sentence, Dark Souls 1 and Dark souls 2 were hard, sometimes brutal but mostly fair with an occasional BS here and there, but that could be forgiven by looking at the overall picture that those iterations of the game conveyed. In Dark Souls 3 however, you have a constant feeling of unfair difficulty made just for the sake of making it difficult. 

That is a real shame becaue DS3 is the most gorgeous looking best polished dark souls game a dame that all souls fans want to experience. 
There are two fundamental issues with tha mid and late boss difficulty. (Mind you, I prevailed over all of them, all beaten melee&solo even though some of them took me long hours of struggle.)
1. The camera issue. Looking here at Midir(of course), Twin princes teleport, Nameless King  first phase, even sister Friede 3rd phase with the BS jump.
3. Having bosses at Bloodborne speed level while you are stuck at DS3 mechanics level: Sister friede as most notorius, Midir laser attack, pointiff Sullivan, Dancer at time and others. good luck dodging them.
4. The difficulty curve: The game stars very mild until you hit the Abyyss Watchers and later Pontiff two huge difficulty spikes, later followed by Sister Friede and Midir. While its OK to have brutally challenging DLC bosses it would not hurt to have fari challenge as well.

From a positive perspective I like the graphics, the combat, and most of the levels. I like some of the bosses:
-Slave knight Gael (an end boss done right, brutally hard but mostly fair with an occasional BS = an attack that is not telegraphed well enough)
-Champion Gundyr
-Abyss watchers (after learning the boss, the iniotial encounter made me quit this game for a year)
-Lord of Cinder
-Nameless king 2nd phase, (first phase is a disaster)
-Dragonslayer Armor

As a conclusion if you are new to the series stay away from DS3. Play the first then the second iteration, not because of the lore knowledge but because of overall arc of bosses and difficulty. DS1 is the best of all series both the ingenious environment and boss design.

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard.
 [*]The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right.
 [*]A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc.
 [*]Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend.
 [*]Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo.
 [*]The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless.
 [*]The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.
[/list]

 [*]Lore and Atmosphere like no other game
 [*]Diversity of bosses and their move-sets
 [*]The challenge is somewhat rewarding, but, personally, most of the time I feel ""wow, I'm glad this shit-show is finally over"" and not ""omg, what an amazing boss fight this was"".

841,841,False,22,12725,"Great game just a real shame that hackers can force hacked items into your inventory thus getting you banned with no warning and no hope of getting it undone. Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3. But then the salty hackers comes online. I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. 

i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.

so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.

I also feel like i cant criticize this game without all the fanboys acting like i just butchered their Sacred cow. I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all. I had to literally go offline for the aldrichs faithful area cause of how insane it gets. Which is sad cause i used to love the coop community and the invasion community.

Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react......that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one. ""go offline"" isn't a solution its a testament to how bad this game is with pvp.

what you have done will ultimately kill the game, cheaters will just keep doing what they do because thats what cheaters do, sure it will deter a few, but those that keep plugging along will enjoy having the knowledge that if they inject invalid items into multiple inventories at once that they will have caused more turmoil and rage than normal because now, its either BUY THE GAME AGAIN or spend 2 weeks just trying to get unbanned, and with your support team being as small as it is, this process could take longer and longer until people find the effort and money not worth it and then permanently stop playing your game. and then the cheaters/trolls will have won.

I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. 

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.  However, the reality is that neither this game, nor its nightmarishly bad predecessor improve enough about Dark Souls to justify their combined existence.

933,933,False,1,13322,"After finishing all the content Dark Souls 3 had to offer, I edited my initial review that was made during a huge burst of rage.

Despite this making me very sad, I still keep on the not recommended rating though if there was a middle ground I would have chosen that.

To sum it up in one sentence, Dark Souls 1 and Dark souls 2 were hard, sometimes brutal but mostly fair with an occasional BS here and there, but that could be forgiven by looking at the overall picture that those iterations of the game conveyed. In Dark Souls 3 however, you have a constant feeling of unfair difficulty made just for the sake of making it difficult. 

That is a real shame becaue DS3 is the most gorgeous looking best polished dark souls game a dame that all souls fans want to experience. 
There are two fundamental issues with tha mid and late boss difficulty. (Mind you, I prevailed over all of them, all beaten melee&solo even though some of them took me long hours of struggle.)
1. The camera issue. Looking here at Midir(of course), Twin princes teleport, Nameless King  first phase, even sister Friede 3rd phase with the BS jump.
3. Having bosses at Bloodborne speed level while you are stuck at DS3 mechanics level: Sister friede as most notorius, Midir laser attack, pointiff Sullivan, Dancer at time and others. good luck dodging them.
4. The difficulty curve: The game stars very mild until you hit the Abyyss Watchers and later Pontiff two huge difficulty spikes, later followed by Sister Friede and Midir. While its OK to have brutally challenging DLC bosses it would not hurt to have fari challenge as well.

From a positive perspective I like the graphics, the combat, and most of the levels. I like some of the bosses:
-Slave knight Gael (an end boss done right, brutally hard but mostly fair with an occasional BS = an attack that is not telegraphed well enough)
-Champion Gundyr
-Abyss watchers (after learning the boss, the iniotial encounter made me quit this game for a year)
-Lord of Cinder
-Nameless king 2nd phase, (first phase is a disaster)
-Dragonslayer Armor

As a conclusion if you are new to the series stay away from DS3. Play the first then the second iteration, not because of the lore knowledge but because of overall arc of bosses and difficulty. DS1 is the best of all series both the ingenious environment and boss design.

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard.
 [*]The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right.
 [*]A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc.
 [*]Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend.
 [*]Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo.
 [*]The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless.
 [*]The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.
[/list]

[b]The good:[/b]

 [*]Lore and Atmosphere like no other game
 [*]Diversity of bosses and their move-sets
 [*]The challenge is somewhat rewarding, but, personally, most of the time I feel ""wow, I'm glad this shit-show is finally over"" and not ""omg, what an amazing boss fight this was"".

Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3.

I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. 

i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.

so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.

I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all.

Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react......that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one. ""go offline"" isn't a solution its a testament to how bad this game is with pvp.

what you have done will ultimately kill the game, cheaters will just keep doing what they do because thats what cheaters do, sure it will deter a few, but those that keep plugging along will enjoy having the knowledge that if they inject invalid items into multiple inventories at once that they will have caused more turmoil and rage than normal because now, its either BUY THE GAME AGAIN or spend 2 weeks just trying to get unbanned, and with your support team being as small as it is, this process could take longer and longer until people find the effort and money not worth it and then permanently stop playing your game. and then the cheaters/trolls will have won.

991,991,False,2,4361,"Well, I did it.  I've finished the final Dark Souls game.  This marks the end of my ongoing project to play through the entire series (or what exists of it on PC), in order.  

I came into this endeavor with a moderate dislike for Dark Souls, failing to get more than a few hours into the first game, despite several attempts.  However, I'm pleased to report that after playing all of them through to completion, beating the DLC content, and defeating the optional bosses (i.e. finally managing to ""git good""), I've completely changed my mind.  I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. 

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.  However, the reality is that neither this game, nor its nightmarishly bad predecessor improve enough about Dark Souls to justify their combined existence.

This game's ban system is dogshit.
Pure unadulterated automated robotic dogshit.
Bans can be issued when other players inject bad data onto your file.
Bans can be issued on backups, or even when you transfer saves between accounts.
Bans can be issued on mods that don't give any innate advantages to play.
Bans can last indefinitely (9+ months on wiped data).
Family Sharing was a cool way to continue to enjoy the game despite its terrible ban system and without having to pay for an additional copy. You almost always had to start from scratch, and that always sucked but at least it was possible.
They did away with that, so I recommend you do away with them.

RIP the 73 hrs I spent on a legitimate family shared account farming out items for my newbie brother and doing a NG and NG+ fullclear.

1052,1052,False,1,13322,"After finishing all the content Dark Souls 3 had to offer, I edited my initial review that was made during a huge burst of rage.

Despite this making me very sad, I still keep on the not recommended rating though if there was a middle ground I would have chosen that.

To sum it up in one sentence, Dark Souls 1 and Dark souls 2 were hard, sometimes brutal but mostly fair with an occasional BS here and there, but that could be forgiven by looking at the overall picture that those iterations of the game conveyed. In Dark Souls 3 however, you have a constant feeling of unfair difficulty made just for the sake of making it difficult. 

That is a real shame becaue DS3 is the most gorgeous looking best polished dark souls game a dame that all souls fans want to experience. 
There are two fundamental issues with tha mid and late boss difficulty. (Mind you, I prevailed over all of them, all beaten melee&solo even though some of them took me long hours of struggle.)
1. The camera issue. Looking here at Midir(of course), Twin princes teleport, Nameless King  first phase, even sister Friede 3rd phase with the BS jump.
3. Having bosses at Bloodborne speed level while you are stuck at DS3 mechanics level: Sister friede as most notorius, Midir laser attack, pointiff Sullivan, Dancer at time and others. good luck dodging them.
4. The difficulty curve: The game stars very mild until you hit the Abyyss Watchers and later Pontiff two huge difficulty spikes, later followed by Sister Friede and Midir. While its OK to have brutally challenging DLC bosses it would not hurt to have fari challenge as well.

From a positive perspective I like the graphics, the combat, and most of the levels. I like some of the bosses:
-Slave knight Gael (an end boss done right, brutally hard but mostly fair with an occasional BS = an attack that is not telegraphed well enough)
-Champion Gundyr
-Abyss watchers (after learning the boss, the iniotial encounter made me quit this game for a year)
-Lord of Cinder
-Nameless king 2nd phase, (first phase is a disaster)
-Dragonslayer Armor

As a conclusion if you are new to the series stay away from DS3. Play the first then the second iteration, not because of the lore knowledge but because of overall arc of bosses and difficulty. DS1 is the best of all series both the ingenious environment and boss design.

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard.
 [*]The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right.
 [*]A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc.
 [*]Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend.
 [*]Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo.
 [*]The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless.
 [*]The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.

Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

I also feel like i cant criticize this game without all the fanboys acting like i just butchered their Sacred cow. I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all. I had to literally go offline for the aldrichs faithful area cause of how insane it gets. Which is sad cause i used to love the coop community and the invasion community. I love taking part of it and doing the covenant stuff but this just goes to an extreme. Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react......that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is.

what you have done will ultimately kill the game, cheaters will just keep doing what they do because thats what cheaters do, sure it will deter a few, but those that keep plugging along will enjoy having the knowledge that if they inject invalid items into multiple inventories at once that they will have caused more turmoil and rage than normal because now, its either BUY THE GAME AGAIN or spend 2 weeks just trying to get unbanned, and with your support team being as small as it is, this process could take longer and longer until people find the effort and money not worth it and then permanently stop playing your game. and then the cheaters/trolls will have won.

However, I'm pleased to report that after playing all of them through to completion, beating the DLC content, and defeating the optional bosses (i.e. finally managing to ""git good""), I've completely changed my mind.  I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. 

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.

Bans can be issued when other players inject bad data onto your file.
Bans can be issued on backups, or even when you transfer saves between accounts.
Bans can be issued on mods that don't give any innate advantages to play.
Bans can last indefinitely (9+ months on wiped data).

1171,1171,False,1,13322,"After finishing all the content Dark Souls 3 had to offer, I edited my initial review that was made during a huge burst of rage.

Despite this making me very sad, I still keep on the not recommended rating though if there was a middle ground I would have chosen that.

To sum it up in one sentence, Dark Souls 1 and Dark souls 2 were hard, sometimes brutal but mostly fair with an occasional BS here and there, but that could be forgiven by looking at the overall picture that those iterations of the game conveyed. In Dark Souls 3 however, you have a constant feeling of unfair difficulty made just for the sake of making it difficult. 

That is a real shame becaue DS3 is the most gorgeous looking best polished dark souls game a dame that all souls fans want to experience. 
There are two fundamental issues with tha mid and late boss difficulty. (Mind you, I prevailed over all of them, all beaten melee&solo even though some of them took me long hours of struggle.)
1. The camera issue. Looking here at Midir(of course), Twin princes teleport, Nameless King  first phase, even sister Friede 3rd phase with the BS jump.
3. Having bosses at Bloodborne speed level while you are stuck at DS3 mechanics level: Sister friede as most notorius, Midir laser attack, pointiff Sullivan, Dancer at time and others. good luck dodging them.
4. The difficulty curve: The game stars very mild until you hit the Abyyss Watchers and later Pontiff two huge difficulty spikes, later followed by Sister Friede and Midir. While its OK to have brutally challenging DLC bosses it would not hurt to have fari challenge as well.

From a positive perspective I like the graphics, the combat, and most of the levels. I like some of the bosses:
-Slave knight Gael (an end boss done right, brutally hard but mostly fair with an occasional BS = an attack that is not telegraphed well enough)
-Champion Gundyr
-Abyss watchers (after learning the boss, the iniotial encounter made me quit this game for a year)
-Lord of Cinder
-Nameless king 2nd phase, (first phase is a disaster)
-Dragonslayer Armor

As a conclusion if you are new to the series stay away from DS3. Play the first then the second iteration, not because of the lore knowledge but because of overall arc of bosses and difficulty. DS1 is the best of all series both the ingenious environment and boss design.

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard.
 [*]The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right.
 [*]A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc.
 [*]Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend.
 [*]Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo.
 [*]The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless.
 [*]The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.
[/list]

 [*]Lore and Atmosphere like no other game
 [*]Diversity of bosses and their move-sets
 [*]The challenge is somewhat rewarding, but, personally, most of the time I feel ""wow, I'm glad this shit-show is finally over"" and not ""omg, what an amazing boss fight this was"".

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3. But then the salty hackers comes online. I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. 

i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.

so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.

I also feel like i cant criticize this game without all the fanboys acting like i just butchered their Sacred cow. I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all. I had to literally go offline for the aldrichs faithful area cause of how insane it gets. Which is sad cause i used to love the coop community and the invasion community.

Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react......that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one. ""go offline"" isn't a solution its a testament to how bad this game is with pvp.

sure, ive had to make several alts because of hackers getting me banned but guess what, family share let me keep enjoying this 5 year old game because guess what From/bandai, people that enjoy playing your game will do what needs to be done to keep enjoying it. by removing the only way around your ultra specific yet vague TOS and ban detection, anyone that gets banned now will have to contact you guys directly causing more work to be done on your part to again, which most people dont wanna do because actually getting in contact with the support team is about as direct as trying to get help from steam support 3 years ago. 
what you have done will ultimately kill the game, cheaters will just keep doing what they do because thats what cheaters do, sure it will deter a few, but those that keep plugging along will enjoy having the knowledge that if they inject invalid items into multiple inventories at once that they will have caused more turmoil and rage than normal because now, its either BUY THE GAME AGAIN or spend 2 weeks just trying to get unbanned, and with your support team being as small as it is, this process could take longer and longer until people find the effort and money not worth it and then permanently stop playing your game. and then the cheaters/trolls will have won. 
you gave us the worst solution other than outright turning off the server
im not sure what would be the best solution, but im fairly certain this was not it.

1229,1229,False,2,4361,"Well, I did it.  I've finished the final Dark Souls game.  This marks the end of my ongoing project to play through the entire series (or what exists of it on PC), in order.  

I came into this endeavor with a moderate dislike for Dark Souls, failing to get more than a few hours into the first game, despite several attempts.  However, I'm pleased to report that after playing all of them through to completion, beating the DLC content, and defeating the optional bosses (i.e. finally managing to ""git good""), I've completely changed my mind.  I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. 

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.

This game's ban system is dogshit.
Pure unadulterated automated robotic dogshit.
Bans can be issued when other players inject bad data onto your file.
Bans can be issued on backups, or even when you transfer saves between accounts.
Bans can be issued on mods that don't give any innate advantages to play.
Bans can last indefinitely (9+ months on wiped data).
Family Sharing was a cool way to continue to enjoy the game despite its terrible ban system and without having to pay for an additional copy. You almost always had to start from scratch, and that always sucked but at least it was possible.
They did away with that, so I recommend you do away with them.

RIP the 73 hrs I spent on a legitimate family shared account farming out items for my newbie brother and doing a NG and NG+ fullclear.

1290,1290,False,1,13322,"After finishing all the content Dark Souls 3 had to offer, I edited my initial review that was made during a huge burst of rage.

Despite this making me very sad, I still keep on the not recommended rating though if there was a middle ground I would have chosen that.

To sum it up in one sentence, Dark Souls 1 and Dark souls 2 were hard, sometimes brutal but mostly fair with an occasional BS here and there, but that could be forgiven by looking at the overall picture that those iterations of the game conveyed. In Dark Souls 3 however, you have a constant feeling of unfair difficulty made just for the sake of making it difficult. 

That is a real shame becaue DS3 is the most gorgeous looking best polished dark souls game a dame that all souls fans want to experience. 
There are two fundamental issues with tha mid and late boss difficulty. (Mind you, I prevailed over all of them, all beaten melee&solo even though some of them took me long hours of struggle.)
1. The camera issue. Looking here at Midir(of course), Twin princes teleport, Nameless King  first phase, even sister Friede 3rd phase with the BS jump.
3. Having bosses at Bloodborne speed level while you are stuck at DS3 mechanics level: Sister friede as most notorius, Midir laser attack, pointiff Sullivan, Dancer at time and others. good luck dodging them.
4. The difficulty curve: The game stars very mild until you hit the Abyyss Watchers and later Pontiff two huge difficulty spikes, later followed by Sister Friede and Midir. While its OK to have brutally challenging DLC bosses it would not hurt to have fari challenge as well.

From a positive perspective I like the graphics, the combat, and most of the levels. I like some of the bosses:
-Slave knight Gael (an end boss done right, brutally hard but mostly fair with an occasional BS = an attack that is not telegraphed well enough)
-Champion Gundyr
-Abyss watchers (after learning the boss, the iniotial encounter made me quit this game for a year)
-Lord of Cinder
-Nameless king 2nd phase, (first phase is a disaster)
-Dragonslayer Armor

As a conclusion if you are new to the series stay away from DS3. Play the first then the second iteration, not because of the lore knowledge but because of overall arc of bosses and difficulty. DS1 is the best of all series both the ingenious environment and boss design.

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard.
 [*]The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right.
 [*]A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc.
 [*]Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend.
 [*]Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo.
 [*]The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless.
 [*]The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.

 [*]Diversity of bosses and their move-sets

1317,1317,False,22,12725,"Great game just a real shame that hackers can force hacked items into your inventory thus getting you banned with no warning and no hope of getting it undone. Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3. But then the salty hackers comes online. I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. 

i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.

so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.

I also feel like i cant criticize this game without all the fanboys acting like i just butchered their Sacred cow. I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all. I had to literally go offline for the aldrichs faithful area cause of how insane it gets. Which is sad cause i used to love the coop community and the invasion community. I love taking part of it and doing the covenant stuff but this just goes to an extreme. Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react......that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one.

what you have done will ultimately kill the game, cheaters will just keep doing what they do because thats what cheaters do, sure it will deter a few, but those that keep plugging along will enjoy having the knowledge that if they inject invalid items into multiple inventories at once that they will have caused more turmoil and rage than normal because now, its either BUY THE GAME AGAIN or spend 2 weeks just trying to get unbanned, and with your support team being as small as it is, this process could take longer and longer until people find the effort and money not worth it and then permanently stop playing your game. and then the cheaters/trolls will have won.

1348,1348,False,2,4361,"Well, I did it.  I've finished the final Dark Souls game.  This marks the end of my ongoing project to play through the entire series (or what exists of it on PC), in order.  

I came into this endeavor with a moderate dislike for Dark Souls, failing to get more than a few hours into the first game, despite several attempts.  However, I'm pleased to report that after playing all of them through to completion, beating the DLC content, and defeating the optional bosses (i.e. finally managing to ""git good""), I've completely changed my mind.  I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. 

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.

Bans can be issued on backups, or even when you transfer saves between accounts.
Bans can be issued on mods that don't give any innate advantages to play.
Bans can last indefinitely (9+ months on wiped data).

Also, if you ever look up how to beat certain bosses (and you will end up doing that), you'll probably find that everyone else on youtube has way more health than you, as well as better stamina and other stats, their weapons do way more damage, they have a better ""build"" and they had equipped better items, so the boss fight is easy for them and you won't learn much.

1409,1409,False,1,13322,"After finishing all the content Dark Souls 3 had to offer, I edited my initial review that was made during a huge burst of rage.

Despite this making me very sad, I still keep on the not recommended rating though if there was a middle ground I would have chosen that.

To sum it up in one sentence, Dark Souls 1 and Dark souls 2 were hard, sometimes brutal but mostly fair with an occasional BS here and there, but that could be forgiven by looking at the overall picture that those iterations of the game conveyed. In Dark Souls 3 however, you have a constant feeling of unfair difficulty made just for the sake of making it difficult. 

That is a real shame becaue DS3 is the most gorgeous looking best polished dark souls game a dame that all souls fans want to experience. 
There are two fundamental issues with tha mid and late boss difficulty. (Mind you, I prevailed over all of them, all beaten melee&solo even though some of them took me long hours of struggle.)
1. The camera issue. Looking here at Midir(of course), Twin princes teleport, Nameless King  first phase, even sister Friede 3rd phase with the BS jump.
3. Having bosses at Bloodborne speed level while you are stuck at DS3 mechanics level: Sister friede as most notorius, Midir laser attack, pointiff Sullivan, Dancer at time and others. good luck dodging them.
4. The difficulty curve: The game stars very mild until you hit the Abyyss Watchers and later Pontiff two huge difficulty spikes, later followed by Sister Friede and Midir. While its OK to have brutally challenging DLC bosses it would not hurt to have fari challenge as well.

From a positive perspective I like the graphics, the combat, and most of the levels. I like some of the bosses:
-Slave knight Gael (an end boss done right, brutally hard but mostly fair with an occasional BS = an attack that is not telegraphed well enough)
-Champion Gundyr
-Abyss watchers (after learning the boss, the iniotial encounter made me quit this game for a year)
-Lord of Cinder
-Nameless king 2nd phase, (first phase is a disaster)
-Dragonslayer Armor

As a conclusion if you are new to the series stay away from DS3. Play the first then the second iteration, not because of the lore knowledge but because of overall arc of bosses and difficulty. DS1 is the best of all series both the ingenious environment and boss design.

1418,1418,False,2,4079,"Dark Souls III was designed around all of the worst aspects of the first two games. Enemies feel very cheaty and I think different playstyles are seriously hampered by their new design. One hit kill moves and enemies are more common than ever, especially in the early game.

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard.
 [*]The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right.
 [*]A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc.
 [*]Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend.
 [*]Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo.
 [*]The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless.
 [*]The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.
[/list]

 [*]Lore and Atmosphere like no other game
 [*]Diversity of bosses and their move-sets
 [*]The challenge is somewhat rewarding, but, personally, most of the time I feel ""wow, I'm glad this shit-show is finally over"" and not ""omg, what an amazing boss fight this was"".

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3. But then the salty hackers comes online. I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. 

i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.

so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.

I also feel like i cant criticize this game without all the fanboys acting like i just butchered their Sacred cow. I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all. I had to literally go offline for the aldrichs faithful area cause of how insane it gets. Which is sad cause i used to love the coop community and the invasion community.

Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react......that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one. ""go offline"" isn't a solution its a testament to how bad this game is with pvp.

sure, ive had to make several alts because of hackers getting me banned but guess what, family share let me keep enjoying this 5 year old game because guess what From/bandai, people that enjoy playing your game will do what needs to be done to keep enjoying it. by removing the only way around your ultra specific yet vague TOS and ban detection, anyone that gets banned now will have to contact you guys directly causing more work to be done on your part to again, which most people dont wanna do because actually getting in contact with the support team is about as direct as trying to get help from steam support 3 years ago. 
what you have done will ultimately kill the game, cheaters will just keep doing what they do because thats what cheaters do, sure it will deter a few, but those that keep plugging along will enjoy having the knowledge that if they inject invalid items into multiple inventories at once that they will have caused more turmoil and rage than normal because now, its either BUY THE GAME AGAIN or spend 2 weeks just trying to get unbanned, and with your support team being as small as it is, this process could take longer and longer until people find the effort and money not worth it and then permanently stop playing your game. and then the cheaters/trolls will have won. 
you gave us the worst solution other than outright turning off the server
im not sure what would be the best solution, but im fairly certain this was not it.

1467,1467,False,2,4361,"Well, I did it.  I've finished the final Dark Souls game.  This marks the end of my ongoing project to play through the entire series (or what exists of it on PC), in order.  

I came into this endeavor with a moderate dislike for Dark Souls, failing to get more than a few hours into the first game, despite several attempts.  However, I'm pleased to report that after playing all of them through to completion, beating the DLC content, and defeating the optional bosses (i.e. finally managing to ""git good""), I've completely changed my mind.  I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. 

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.

This game's ban system is dogshit.
Pure unadulterated automated robotic dogshit.
Bans can be issued when other players inject bad data onto your file.
Bans can be issued on backups, or even when you transfer saves between accounts.
Bans can be issued on mods that don't give any innate advantages to play.
Bans can last indefinitely (9+ months on wiped data).
Family Sharing was a cool way to continue to enjoy the game despite its terrible ban system and without having to pay for an additional copy. You almost always had to start from scratch, and that always sucked but at least it was possible.
They did away with that, so I recommend you do away with them.

RIP the 73 hrs I spent on a legitimate family shared account farming out items for my newbie brother and doing a NG and NG+ fullclear.

1528,1528,False,1,13322,"After finishing all the content Dark Souls 3 had to offer, I edited my initial review that was made during a huge burst of rage.

Despite this making me very sad, I still keep on the not recommended rating though if there was a middle ground I would have chosen that.

To sum it up in one sentence, Dark Souls 1 and Dark souls 2 were hard, sometimes brutal but mostly fair with an occasional BS here and there, but that could be forgiven by looking at the overall picture that those iterations of the game conveyed. In Dark Souls 3 however, you have a constant feeling of unfair difficulty made just for the sake of making it difficult. 

That is a real shame becaue DS3 is the most gorgeous looking best polished dark souls game a dame that all souls fans want to experience. 
There are two fundamental issues with tha mid and late boss difficulty. (Mind you, I prevailed over all of them, all beaten melee&solo even though some of them took me long hours of struggle.)
1. The camera issue. Looking here at Midir(of course), Twin princes teleport, Nameless King  first phase, even sister Friede 3rd phase with the BS jump.
3. Having bosses at Bloodborne speed level while you are stuck at DS3 mechanics level: Sister friede as most notorius, Midir laser attack, pointiff Sullivan, Dancer at time and others. good luck dodging them.
4. The difficulty curve: The game stars very mild until you hit the Abyyss Watchers and later Pontiff two huge difficulty spikes, later followed by Sister Friede and Midir. While its OK to have brutally challenging DLC bosses it would not hurt to have fari challenge as well.

From a positive perspective I like the graphics, the combat, and most of the levels. I like some of the bosses:
-Slave knight Gael (an end boss done right, brutally hard but mostly fair with an occasional BS = an attack that is not telegraphed well enough)
-Champion Gundyr
-Abyss watchers (after learning the boss, the iniotial encounter made me quit this game for a year)
-Lord of Cinder
-Nameless king 2nd phase, (first phase is a disaster)
-Dragonslayer Armor

As a conclusion if you are new to the series stay away from DS3. Play the first then the second iteration, not because of the lore knowledge but because of overall arc of bosses and difficulty. DS1 is the best of all series both the ingenious environment and boss design. 
If you are a veteran of the series and have big reserver of patience and endurance or simply are very good at reflexes then sure go ahead.

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard.
 [*]The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right.
 [*]A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc.
 [*]Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend.
 [*]Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo.
 [*]The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless.
 [*]The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.

 [*]Diversity of bosses and their move-sets

1555,1555,False,22,12725,"Great game just a real shame that hackers can force hacked items into your inventory thus getting you banned with no warning and no hope of getting it undone. Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3. But then the salty hackers comes online. I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. 

i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.

so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.

I also feel like i cant criticize this game without all the fanboys acting like i just butchered their Sacred cow. I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all. I had to literally go offline for the aldrichs faithful area cause of how insane it gets. Which is sad cause i used to love the coop community and the invasion community. I love taking part of it and doing the covenant stuff but this just goes to an extreme. Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react......that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one.

what you have done will ultimately kill the game, cheaters will just keep doing what they do because thats what cheaters do, sure it will deter a few, but those that keep plugging along will enjoy having the knowledge that if they inject invalid items into multiple inventories at once that they will have caused more turmoil and rage than normal because now, its either BUY THE GAME AGAIN or spend 2 weeks just trying to get unbanned, and with your support team being as small as it is, this process could take longer and longer until people find the effort and money not worth it and then permanently stop playing your game. and then the cheaters/trolls will have won.

1586,1586,False,2,4361,"Well, I did it.  I've finished the final Dark Souls game.  This marks the end of my ongoing project to play through the entire series (or what exists of it on PC), in order.  

I came into this endeavor with a moderate dislike for Dark Souls, failing to get more than a few hours into the first game, despite several attempts.  However, I'm pleased to report that after playing all of them through to completion, beating the DLC content, and defeating the optional bosses (i.e. finally managing to ""git good""), I've completely changed my mind.  I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. 

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.

Bans can be issued on backups, or even when you transfer saves between accounts.
Bans can be issued on mods that don't give any innate advantages to play.
Bans can last indefinitely (9+ months on wiped data).

Also, if you ever look up how to beat certain bosses (and you will end up doing that), you'll probably find that everyone else on youtube has way more health than you, as well as better stamina and other stats, their weapons do way more damage, they have a better ""build"" and they had equipped better items, so the boss fight is easy for them and you won't learn much.

1647,1647,False,1,13322,"After finishing all the content Dark Souls 3 had to offer, I edited my initial review that was made during a huge burst of rage.

Despite this making me very sad, I still keep on the not recommended rating though if there was a middle ground I would have chosen that.

To sum it up in one sentence, Dark Souls 1 and Dark souls 2 were hard, sometimes brutal but mostly fair with an occasional BS here and there, but that could be forgiven by looking at the overall picture that those iterations of the game conveyed. In Dark Souls 3 however, you have a constant feeling of unfair difficulty made just for the sake of making it difficult. 

That is a real shame becaue DS3 is the most gorgeous looking best polished dark souls game a dame that all souls fans want to experience. 
There are two fundamental issues with tha mid and late boss difficulty. (Mind you, I prevailed over all of them, all beaten melee&solo even though some of them took me long hours of struggle.)
1. The camera issue. Looking here at Midir(of course), Twin princes teleport, Nameless King  first phase, even sister Friede 3rd phase with the BS jump.
3. Having bosses at Bloodborne speed level while you are stuck at DS3 mechanics level: Sister friede as most notorius, Midir laser attack, pointiff Sullivan, Dancer at time and others. good luck dodging them.
4. The difficulty curve: The game stars very mild until you hit the Abyyss Watchers and later Pontiff two huge difficulty spikes, later followed by Sister Friede and Midir. While its OK to have brutally challenging DLC bosses it would not hurt to have fari challenge as well.

From a positive perspective I like the graphics, the combat, and most of the levels. I like some of the bosses:
-Slave knight Gael (an end boss done right, brutally hard but mostly fair with an occasional BS = an attack that is not telegraphed well enough)
-Champion Gundyr
-Abyss watchers (after learning the boss, the iniotial encounter made me quit this game for a year)
-Lord of Cinder
-Nameless king 2nd phase, (first phase is a disaster)
-Dragonslayer Armor

As a conclusion if you are new to the series stay away from DS3. Play the first then the second iteration, not because of the lore knowledge but because of overall arc of bosses and difficulty. DS1 is the best of all series both the ingenious environment and boss design.

1656,1656,False,2,4079,"Dark Souls III was designed around all of the worst aspects of the first two games. Enemies feel very cheaty and I think different playstyles are seriously hampered by their new design. One hit kill moves and enemies are more common than ever, especially in the early game.

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard.
 [*]The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right.
 [*]A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc.
 [*]Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend.
 [*]Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo.
 [*]The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless.
 [*]The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.
[/list]

 [*]Lore and Atmosphere like no other game
 [*]Diversity of bosses and their move-sets
 [*]The challenge is somewhat rewarding, but, personally, most of the time I feel ""wow, I'm glad this shit-show is finally over"" and not ""omg, what an amazing boss fight this was"".

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3. But then the salty hackers comes online. I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. 

i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.

so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.

I also feel like i cant criticize this game without all the fanboys acting like i just butchered their Sacred cow. I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all. I had to literally go offline for the aldrichs faithful area cause of how insane it gets. Which is sad cause i used to love the coop community and the invasion community.

Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react......that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one. ""go offline"" isn't a solution its a testament to how bad this game is with pvp.

sure, ive had to make several alts because of hackers getting me banned but guess what, family share let me keep enjoying this 5 year old game because guess what From/bandai, people that enjoy playing your game will do what needs to be done to keep enjoying it. by removing the only way around your ultra specific yet vague TOS and ban detection, anyone that gets banned now will have to contact you guys directly causing more work to be done on your part to again, which most people dont wanna do because actually getting in contact with the support team is about as direct as trying to get help from steam support 3 years ago. 
what you have done will ultimately kill the game, cheaters will just keep doing what they do because thats what cheaters do, sure it will deter a few, but those that keep plugging along will enjoy having the knowledge that if they inject invalid items into multiple inventories at once that they will have caused more turmoil and rage than normal because now, its either BUY THE GAME AGAIN or spend 2 weeks just trying to get unbanned, and with your support team being as small as it is, this process could take longer and longer until people find the effort and money not worth it and then permanently stop playing your game. and then the cheaters/trolls will have won. 
you gave us the worst solution other than outright turning off the server
im not sure what would be the best solution, but im fairly certain this was not it.

1705,1705,False,2,4361,"Well, I did it.  I've finished the final Dark Souls game.  This marks the end of my ongoing project to play through the entire series (or what exists of it on PC), in order.  

I came into this endeavor with a moderate dislike for Dark Souls, failing to get more than a few hours into the first game, despite several attempts.  However, I'm pleased to report that after playing all of them through to completion, beating the DLC content, and defeating the optional bosses (i.e. finally managing to ""git good""), I've completely changed my mind.  I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. 

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.

This game's ban system is dogshit.
Pure unadulterated automated robotic dogshit.
Bans can be issued when other players inject bad data onto your file.
Bans can be issued on backups, or even when you transfer saves between accounts.
Bans can be issued on mods that don't give any innate advantages to play.
Bans can last indefinitely (9+ months on wiped data).
Family Sharing was a cool way to continue to enjoy the game despite its terrible ban system and without having to pay for an additional copy. You almost always had to start from scratch, and that always sucked but at least it was possible.
They did away with that, so I recommend you do away with them.

RIP the 73 hrs I spent on a legitimate family shared account farming out items for my newbie brother and doing a NG and NG+ fullclear.

1766,1766,False,1,13322,"After finishing all the content Dark Souls 3 had to offer, I edited my initial review that was made during a huge burst of rage.

Despite this making me very sad, I still keep on the not recommended rating though if there was a middle ground I would have chosen that.

To sum it up in one sentence, Dark Souls 1 and Dark souls 2 were hard, sometimes brutal but mostly fair with an occasional BS here and there, but that could be forgiven by looking at the overall picture that those iterations of the game conveyed. In Dark Souls 3 however, you have a constant feeling of unfair difficulty made just for the sake of making it difficult. 

That is a real shame becaue DS3 is the most gorgeous looking best polished dark souls game a dame that all souls fans want to experience. 
There are two fundamental issues with tha mid and late boss difficulty. (Mind you, I prevailed over all of them, all beaten melee&solo even though some of them took me long hours of struggle.)
1. The camera issue. Looking here at Midir(of course), Twin princes teleport, Nameless King  first phase, even sister Friede 3rd phase with the BS jump.
3. Having bosses at Bloodborne speed level while you are stuck at DS3 mechanics level: Sister friede as most notorius, Midir laser attack, pointiff Sullivan, Dancer at time and others. good luck dodging them.
4. The difficulty curve: The game stars very mild until you hit the Abyyss Watchers and later Pontiff two huge difficulty spikes, later followed by Sister Friede and Midir. While its OK to have brutally challenging DLC bosses it would not hurt to have fari challenge as well.

From a positive perspective I like the graphics, the combat, and most of the levels. I like some of the bosses:
-Slave knight Gael (an end boss done right, brutally hard but mostly fair with an occasional BS = an attack that is not telegraphed well enough)
-Champion Gundyr
-Abyss watchers (after learning the boss, the iniotial encounter made me quit this game for a year)
-Lord of Cinder
-Nameless king 2nd phase, (first phase is a disaster)
-Dragonslayer Armor

As a conclusion if you are new to the series stay away from DS3. Play the first then the second iteration, not because of the lore knowledge but because of overall arc of bosses and difficulty. DS1 is the best of all series both the ingenious environment and boss design. 
If you are a veteran of the series and have big reserver of patience and endurance or simply are very good at reflexes then sure go ahead.

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard.
 [*]The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right.
 [*]A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc.
 [*]Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend.
 [*]Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo.
 [*]The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless.
 [*]The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.

 [*]Diversity of bosses and their move-sets

1793,1793,False,22,12725,"Great game just a real shame that hackers can force hacked items into your inventory thus getting you banned with no warning and no hope of getting it undone. Now this was already an issue and has been pretty much the whole lifetime of the game but recently Fromsoft/Namco Bandai removed the family and friends sharing option which was the only real defence you had for not getting your legit copy banned by sharing the game and playing it through a separate account so when/if you get banned though a third party acting maliciously you could still play the game as intended. (though it would normally cost you the current save as well up until your last manual backup assuming you though far enough ahead to manually back up your saves for an online game . . . )

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3. But then the salty hackers comes online. I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. 

i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.

so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.

I also feel like i cant criticize this game without all the fanboys acting like i just butchered their Sacred cow. I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all. I had to literally go offline for the aldrichs faithful area cause of how insane it gets. Which is sad cause i used to love the coop community and the invasion community. I love taking part of it and doing the covenant stuff but this just goes to an extreme. Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react......that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one.

what you have done will ultimately kill the game, cheaters will just keep doing what they do because thats what cheaters do, sure it will deter a few, but those that keep plugging along will enjoy having the knowledge that if they inject invalid items into multiple inventories at once that they will have caused more turmoil and rage than normal because now, its either BUY THE GAME AGAIN or spend 2 weeks just trying to get unbanned, and with your support team being as small as it is, this process could take longer and longer until people find the effort and money not worth it and then permanently stop playing your game. and then the cheaters/trolls will have won.

1824,1824,False,2,4361,"Well, I did it.  I've finished the final Dark Souls game.  This marks the end of my ongoing project to play through the entire series (or what exists of it on PC), in order.

However, I'm pleased to report that after playing all of them through to completion, beating the DLC content, and defeating the optional bosses (i.e. finally managing to ""git good""), I've completely changed my mind.  I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. 

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.

Bans can be issued on backups, or even when you transfer saves between accounts.
Bans can be issued on mods that don't give any innate advantages to play.
Bans can last indefinitely (9+ months on wiped data).

Also, if you ever look up how to beat certain bosses (and you will end up doing that), you'll probably find that everyone else on youtube has way more health than you, as well as better stamina and other stats, their weapons do way more damage, they have a better ""build"" and they had equipped better items, so the boss fight is easy for them and you won't learn much.

1885,1885,False,1,13322,"After finishing all the content Dark Souls 3 had to offer, I edited my initial review that was made during a huge burst of rage.

Despite this making me very sad, I still keep on the not recommended rating though if there was a middle ground I would have chosen that.

To sum it up in one sentence, Dark Souls 1 and Dark souls 2 were hard, sometimes brutal but mostly fair with an occasional BS here and there, but that could be forgiven by looking at the overall picture that those iterations of the game conveyed. In Dark Souls 3 however, you have a constant feeling of unfair difficulty made just for the sake of making it difficult. 

That is a real shame becaue DS3 is the most gorgeous looking best polished dark souls game a dame that all souls fans want to experience. 
There are two fundamental issues with tha mid and late boss difficulty. (Mind you, I prevailed over all of them, all beaten melee&solo even though some of them took me long hours of struggle.)
1. The camera issue. Looking here at Midir(of course), Twin princes teleport, Nameless King  first phase, even sister Friede 3rd phase with the BS jump.
3. Having bosses at Bloodborne speed level while you are stuck at DS3 mechanics level: Sister friede as most notorius, Midir laser attack, pointiff Sullivan, Dancer at time and others. good luck dodging them.
4. The difficulty curve: The game stars very mild until you hit the Abyyss Watchers and later Pontiff two huge difficulty spikes, later followed by Sister Friede and Midir. While its OK to have brutally challenging DLC bosses it would not hurt to have fari challenge as well.

From a positive perspective I like the graphics, the combat, and most of the levels. I like some of the bosses:
-Slave knight Gael (an end boss done right, brutally hard but mostly fair with an occasional BS = an attack that is not telegraphed well enough)
-Champion Gundyr
-Abyss watchers (after learning the boss, the iniotial encounter made me quit this game for a year)
-Lord of Cinder
-Nameless king 2nd phase, (first phase is a disaster)
-Dragonslayer Armor

As a conclusion if you are new to the series stay away from DS3. Play the first then the second iteration, not because of the lore knowledge but because of overall arc of bosses and difficulty. DS1 is the best of all series both the ingenious environment and boss design.

1894,1894,False,2,4079,"Dark Souls III was designed around all of the worst aspects of the first two games. Enemies feel very cheaty and I think different playstyles are seriously hampered by their new design. One hit kill moves and enemies are more common than ever, especially in the early game.

[b]The bad:[/b]
[list]
 [*]Despite the popularity and this being 3rd Dark Souls game, the port is still something that should be shameful in 2016. All guide controls displayed are with controller visualizations. Not PC user friendly. Obviously the game is recommended to be played with a controller, but if you release a game on a PC, you should presume that a lot of people will be playing with a mouse & keyboard.
 [*]The actual movement is better than the previous Dark Souls games, but still often feels clunky/ slippery, which is especially noticeable where where one imprecise move or unintentional slip means your death. I fell like, for a game so unforgiving, this should be the most important thing to get right.
 [*]A lot of cheap feeling ""jump-scares"" that is almost like the Dark Souls trademark, but in connection with the clunky/ slipper movement, makes your character do all the wrong things like slipping off the cliff, being stuck or unable to properly evade attacks etc.
 [*]Haven't seen a more annoying implementation of an online co-op version to play with your friend.
 [*]Beating bosses in co-op is too easy comparing to solo.
 [*]The cheaters invading player worlds and their impact on ""infecting"" innocent players with many hours with ridiculous amounts of gems or items that gets them soft-banned are countless.
 [*]The lack of any direction in the maps makes you wander around the different locations sometimes for hours, trying to find the next necessary piece for advancing the story. I understand that the game is ""hardcore"" but this, in my opinion, doesn't make the playing experience better for anyone.
[/list]

 [*]Lore and Atmosphere like no other game
 [*]Diversity of bosses and their move-sets
 [*]The challenge is somewhat rewarding, but, personally, most of the time I feel ""wow, I'm glad this shit-show is finally over"" and not ""omg, what an amazing boss fight this was"".

This only really harms legit players as hackers were already getting around the item checks and ban waves anyway and have been for a long time.

Also, this means that anyone using legit mods (as in mods not made for cheating in PvP but changing the game itself adding more challenge e.c.t) now has a choice of playing the vanilla game as intended or using mods and catching a ban for doing so.

This was a poor choice and really makes me think less of Fromsoft/Namco Bandai and makes me wonder if they will pull stuff like this further down the line with things like Elden ring.

so i learn about family share ""nice"" make a new account beat the game legit this time and start looking up whats ""bannable"" and whats not during this time i see a few videos around about peoples homemade boss characters and think wow that would be Amazing!, So i make one myself do a few matches in a high PvP area get all around well reception :3. But then the salty hackers comes online. I had decided to do a role play in the ringed city where i was the ""Void Lord"" causally strolling through the city with my phantoms acting as my royal guard. now as a side note i want to point out how much work it is to change anything in the game EVERY EFFECT AND EVERY CHANGE MUST BE MANUALLY IMPUTED EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME this takes hours my fastest time being two hours of raw data setting. 

i start my walk through the city not hiding that the ""hacks"" are in place i also want to point out that my ""boss""character does not fight and is very beatable not broken just flashy. but no a hacker who's character name is end see this as cheating breaks the role play invades me and insta curses me. Not only does he do this once but keeps invading just to insta curse. ""but Stormy"" you say ""you were hacking you deserve this"" i was trying to host a fun little role play not break the PvP element to the game. so i think to myself ""ok this dude is the only one its a bad day to do this"" log off and try again tomorrow.

so again i get problems i log on the next day everyone plays along the invaders if have fun AS THE WHOLE THING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. but then i find out that one of the players not only hacks items into the account to ban it but he also HACKS THE FAMILY SHARE ACCOUNT TO FORCEFULLY DISABLE THE FAMILY SHARE ON THE GAME.

I loved the pvp in dark souls 1 and 2 so its not like i just don't like dark souls pvp. I'm not sure what i don't like more. How toxic this game can be or the people who are willing to defend it. Its like people cant understand that maybe there's a happy medium between getting invaded every 10 minutes by someone whos clearly got far better stuff then you and never getting invaded at all. I had to literally go offline for the aldrichs faithful area cause of how insane it gets. Which is sad cause i used to love the coop community and the invasion community.

Hopefully this is just cause of the covid-19 and everyone is just online right now cause if this is the norm i have seriously lost respect for these developers. Also when people say that is excusable merely cause those are the intended game mechanics i really think you have your head up your dark hole. Just cause its an intended game mechanic doesn't even remotely mean that its a good one. I can make a game mechanic that makes it so you have to hit an enemy 1 million times before you kill then and they only have to hit you once to kill you plus your character is blind so your screens black and oh your opponent can move faster than you can react......that doesn't mean anything cause just its in the game. And those who say ""stop complaining and just play offline"" just show how bad the pvp really is. Cause that means i literally have to stop playing a decently big part of the game all cause of one toxic mechanic. I shouldn't have to forgo many fun gaming mechanics cause of one terrible one. ""go offline"" isn't a solution its a testament to how bad this game is with pvp.

sure, ive had to make several alts because of hackers getting me banned but guess what, family share let me keep enjoying this 5 year old game because guess what From/bandai, people that enjoy playing your game will do what needs to be done to keep enjoying it. by removing the only way around your ultra specific yet vague TOS and ban detection, anyone that gets banned now will have to contact you guys directly causing more work to be done on your part to again, which most people dont wanna do because actually getting in contact with the support team is about as direct as trying to get help from steam support 3 years ago. 
what you have done will ultimately kill the game, cheaters will just keep doing what they do because thats what cheaters do, sure it will deter a few, but those that keep plugging along will enjoy having the knowledge that if they inject invalid items into multiple inventories at once that they will have caused more turmoil and rage than normal because now, its either BUY THE GAME AGAIN or spend 2 weeks just trying to get unbanned, and with your support team being as small as it is, this process could take longer and longer until people find the effort and money not worth it and then permanently stop playing your game. and then the cheaters/trolls will have won. 
you gave us the worst solution other than outright turning off the server
im not sure what would be the best solution, but im fairly certain this was not it.

1943,1943,False,2,4361,"Well, I did it.  I've finished the final Dark Souls game.  This marks the end of my ongoing project to play through the entire series (or what exists of it on PC), in order.  

I came into this endeavor with a moderate dislike for Dark Souls, failing to get more than a few hours into the first game, despite several attempts.  However, I'm pleased to report that after playing all of them through to completion, beating the DLC content, and defeating the optional bosses (i.e. finally managing to ""git good""), I've completely changed my mind.  I have cast off the shallow disdain I held for the Souls series when I was a casual...and replaced it with the implacable loathing of a connoisseur. 

Had Dark Souls 3 managed to truly revamp the combat system, instead of just making everyone attack faster, or if f it had bothered to fix the awful camera, instead of exploiting it for cheap deaths, then maybe I'd feel differently.

Sadly, the series concludes with an entry that is essentially Dark Souls 1 fanfiction, repeating not only the themes, narrative structure, and level design of the original but even the actual levels themselves.  Furthermore, DS3 somehow manages to be significantly more linear and bland, with most areas being some flavor of disused castle/castle environs.

Calling something ""Dark Souls 1, but slightly worse"" is about as backhanded a compliment as I can think of.

This game's ban system is dogshit.
Pure unadulterated automated robotic dogshit.
Bans can be issued when other players inject bad data onto your file.
Bans can be issued on backups, or even when you transfer saves between accounts.
Bans can be issued on mods that don't give any innate advantages to play.
Bans can last indefinitely (9+ months on wiped data).
Family Sharing was a cool way to continue to enjoy the game despite its terrible ban system and without having to pay for an additional copy. You almost always had to start from scratch, and that always sucked but at least it was possible.
They did away with that, so I recommend you do away with them.

RIP the 73 hrs I spent on a legitimate family shared account farming out items for my newbie brother and doing a NG and NG+ fullclear.

For me, this just constantly makes me wonder if I'm doing the right thing, instead of being able to enjoy the game. It really punishes you for not making a good ""build"" and has exceptions to lots of rules and you end up playing 80% of the time and googling the other 20%. There are also lots of characters to talk to and items and pick up in an exact order in random parts of the maps, even places where you've been before ages ago. And sometimes you should kill these NPCs and sometimes you shouldn't. More googling required. Also, if you ever look up how to beat certain bosses (and you will end up doing that), you'll probably find that everyone else on youtube has way more health than you, as well as better stamina and other stats, their weapons do way more damage, they have a better ""build"" and they had equipped better items, so the boss fight is easy for them and you won't learn much.

To me, a game you have to google in order to play it properly and have any chance of completing....isn't a good game. I also completed it twice (on NG+) so no, I'm not just ""bad at the game"" :)
